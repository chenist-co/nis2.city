## CISO as a Service for NIS2 Compliance

Our Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) service provides strategic cybersecurity leadership specifically designed to help organizations achieve and maintain NIS2 compliance without the cost of a full-time executive.

### Why NIS2 Requires CISO-Level Leadership

The NIS2 Directive explicitly mandates:
- **Management Accountability**: Executive leadership must approve and oversee cybersecurity measures
- **Board Reporting**: Regular reporting to management bodies on security posture and risks
- **Strategic Oversight**: Integration of cybersecurity into business strategy and operations
- **Compliance Coordination**: Cross-functional coordination of compliance activities

Many organizations, especially medium-sized entities, need this strategic leadership but cannot justify a full-time CISO. Our vCISO service bridges this gap.
