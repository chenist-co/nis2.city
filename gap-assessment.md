## NIS2 Gap Assessment Services

Our NIS2 Gap Assessment provides a detailed analysis of the delta between your current security posture and NIS2 requirements, delivering actionable recommendations for achieving compliance efficiently and cost-effectively.

### What is a Gap Assessment?

A gap assessment is a focused evaluation that:
- **Documents** your current security controls and practices
- **Compares** them against NIS2 requirements
- **Identifies** specific gaps and deficiencies
- **Prioritizes** remediation based on risk and impact
- **Recommends** concrete actions to close gaps
- **Roadmaps** implementation timeline and resources

Unlike a full compliance assessment, a gap assessment is faster and more focused on identifying and prioritizing what needs to be done to achieve compliance.

### Who Needs a Gap Assessment?

A NIS2 gap assessment is ideal for organizations that:
- **Know they must comply** with NIS2 but haven't started
- **Have existing security** programs but need NIS2-specific alignment
- **Face upcoming audits** and need to understand readiness
- **Need to budget** for compliance initiatives

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is a gap assessment different from a full compliance assessment?**
A: A gap assessment is more focused and faster. It identifies what's missing or deficient compared to NIS2 requirements and provides a remediation roadmap. A full compliance assessment provides more comprehensive evaluation including control testing and compliance opinions.

**Q: Can we use the gap assessment report for audit purposes?**
A: The gap assessment is designed for internal planning and remediation. While some organizations share it with auditors to demonstrate proactive compliance efforts, it's not a substitute for an independent audit.

**Q: What if we find too many gaps to address?**
A: That's why prioritization is a key part of our assessment. We help you understand which gaps are critical for compliance and security, and which can be addressed over time. Most organizations address gaps in phases over 12-24 months.

**Q: Do we need to remediate all gaps before the NIS2 deadline?**
A: You should remediate critical and high-priority gaps by the deadline. Medium and low-priority gaps can often be addressed in subsequent phases with documented risk acceptance in the interim.

**Q: Can you help us implement the remediation roadmap?**
A: Yes! We offer implementation support services ranging from ad-hoc consulting to full program management through our vCISO services.

**Q: How often should we do a gap assessment?**
A: We recommend an initial gap assessment followed by annual reassessments to identify new gaps from business changes, regulatory updates, or evolving threats.
