## NIS2 Training & Awareness Programs

The NIS2 Directive explicitly mandates cybersecurity training and awareness programs as one of its 10 mandatory security measures. Our comprehensive training services help organizations build a security-conscious workforce while meeting all NIS2 compliance requirements.

### Why NIS2 Training is Mandatory

The [NIS2 Directive (EU) 2022/2555](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj/eng) requires organizations to implement "cybersecurity training and practices for basic computer hygiene" as a fundamental security measure (Article 21, paragraph 2, point g).

**Key Training Requirements:**
- **Management Oversight**: Leadership must be trained on cybersecurity measures and risk management
- **Workforce Education**: All employees must receive regular cybersecurity awareness training
- **Basic Cyber Hygiene**: Training must cover fundamental security practices
- **Ongoing Programs**: Training must be continuous, not one-time events
- **Effectiveness Measurement**: Organizations must evaluate and document training effectiveness
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive records of training programs and attendance must be maintained
